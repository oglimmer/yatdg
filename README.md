Yet Another Tower-Defense Game (a.k.a. yatdg)
=============================================

1.) There is a dependecy to java-websockets (https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket/), but since this jar cannot be found on a public maven repository you have to import it locally.

=> go to the "mvn" directory and execute `import_locally.sh`

2.) to build the game use `mvn package`
